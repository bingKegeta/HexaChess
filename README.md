# HexaChess

HexaChess is a web-based game that brings a unique twist to the classic game of chess by introducing a hexagonal board following the rules of [Glinski's Hexagonal Chess](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexagonal_chess#Gli%C5%84ski's_hexagonal_chess). This project aims to provide an engaging and strategic gameplay experience with a modern web application interface.

## Overview

HexaChess is a personal project that reimagines traditional chess on a hexagonal board. This game is built using React with TypeScript for the frontend and Go for the backend. The goal is to create a seamless and intuitive user experience while offering a challenging and enjoyable game of chess.

## Features

- **Hexagonal Chessboard**: A unique hexagonal chessboard layout that adds a new layer of strategy to the game.
- **Modern UI**: A clean and responsive user interface built with React and TailwindCSS (planned).
- **Backend with Go**: A robust backend powered by Go to handle game logic and player interactions (planned).
- **Real-time Gameplay**: Interactive and real-time gameplay experience (planned).

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: React, TypeScript, TailwindCSS (planned)
- **Backend**: Go
- **Database**: SQLite (planned)

> P.S. I do have plans on containerizing the entire project using Nix/Docker but will start that after the MVP is finished first :D
